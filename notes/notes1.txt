Date - 27-12-2020 React.js

React is javascript library which is used to develop frontend ui.

It uses component based approach.
    component is nothing but peice of code. i.e,
    if some lines of code is repeating then we can create a component which contains that code.
    and whenever require we can call that component rather then writing all lines again.
    Means components are reuseable.

It uses declaritive approach.

DOM updates are handled very gracefully in react.
